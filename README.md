# Fingerprint Spoofing Detection

The project task consists of a binary classification problem. The goal is to perform fingerprint spoofing detection, i.e. to identify genuine vs counterfeit fingerprint images. The dataset consists of labeled samples corresponding to the genuine (True, label 1) class and the fake (False, label 0) class. The samples are computed by a feature extractor that summarizes high-level characteristics of a fingerprint image. The dataset is 6-dimensional.
